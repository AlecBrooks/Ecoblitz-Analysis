## **Abstract** 📄

From agriculture and infrastructure to energy and water supplies, climate acts as a significant factor affecting societal functionality and health. As weather and climate change become more volatile, it's essential to examine their impact on biodiversity. 

This project utilizes data gathered locally by faculty and students from the **Biology Department at Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC)**, supported by additional data from **iNaturalist** 🌍, an app where citizen scientists share geo-tagged observations of plant and animal life. With over **1.8 million observations recorded within the US**, iNaturalist serves as a powerful resource for our research. Through this collaboration, we aim to explore the complexity of weather's impact on our local biodiversity.

## **Introduction** 🌎

The **Great Basin region**, renowned for its bitterly cold winters ❄️ and scorching, dry summers ☀️, traditionally has a climate defined by extremes, imposing constraints on plant growth:

- **Winters:** Too cold for growth. 🥶
- **Summers:** Dry and drought-prone. 🌵
- **Growth Seasons:** March–May (spring) and June–September (fall). 🌱

Key flora such as **sagebrush** and other shrubs persist year-round due to their non-deciduous nature (Comstock & Ehleringer, 1992).

Recent shifts in climatic patterns, attributed to **climate change**, have resulted in rising temperatures 🌡️ and altered precipitation patterns 🌧️. These changes impact biodiversity distribution (Iknayan & Beissinger, 2020). 

### **Objectives** 🎯
1. **Evaluate** the influence of climate change on ecosystems in Reno, Nevada.
2. **Investigate** trends in local weather patterns.
3. **Explore** the relationship between seasons, climate, and biodiversity.
4. **Identify** differences in biodiversity attributable to climate change.

This research relies on data from the **Ecoblitz events** organized by TMCC.

## **Methodology** 🧪

### **Data Sources**
1. **iNaturalist Data:**  
   - **Observations:** Six datasets (Spring & Fall, 2021–2023).  
   - **Collection Process:**  
     - Data gathered during TMCC Ecoblitz events in May and October (2021–2023).  
     - Events segmented by habitat (8–10 AM: Forest/Grassland 🌲, 11 AM–1 PM: Sagebrush 🌾, 2–4 PM: Wetland/Riparian 🌊).
   - **Inclusion Criteria:** Observations with taxonomy information within San Rafael Ranch Park boundaries.  
   - **Exclusions:** Observations without specific organism type or by non-Ecoblitz participants.

2. **Vegetation Data:**  
   - **Collection:** Faculty and students delineated three zones—**Forest/Grassland** 🌳, **Sagebrush** 🌿, and **Riparian/Wetland** 💧—using satellite imagery, maps, and field surveys.  
   - **Methodology:** Point-intercept method for vegetation surveys, documenting flowering phenology in **May and October 2021**.

### **Data Cleaning & Analysis** 🖥️
- Both datasets were processed using **R Studio** for statistical cleaning and analysis.
