# Ecoblitz-Analysis

---

### Abstract 

From agriculture and infrastructure to energy and water supplies, climate acts as a significant factor affecting societal functionality and health. As weather and climate change become more volatile, it's essential to examine their impact on biodiversity. This project utilizes data gathered locally by faculty and students from the biology department at Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), supported by additional data from iNaturalist, an app where citizen scientists share geo-tagged observations of plant and animal life. With over 1.8 million observations recorded within the US, iNaturalist serves as a powerful resource for our research. Through this collaboration, we aim to explore the complexity of weather's impact on our local biodiversity.

### Introduction

The Great Basin region, renowned for its bitterly cold winters and scorching, dry summers, traditionally has a climate defined by extremes. Thus, it imposes constraints on plant growth due to its extreme weather conditions. Winters are too cold while summers bring drought. The growth seasons are typically from March to May in spring and from June to September in fall. Sagebrush and other shrubs persist year-round as they are not deciduous (Comstock & Ehleringer, 1992). 
In recent years, the Great Basin region has witnessed a notable shift in its climatic patterns, attributed largely to the overarching phenomenon of climate change. The rising temperatures and altered perception patterns in this region have been impacting biodiversity distributions (Iknayan & Beissinger, 2020).
This project aims to evaluate the influence of climate change on the ecosystems of Reno, Nevada. We aim to investigate potential variations or trends in local weather patterns and explore the relationship between seasons, climate, and the biodiversity of the area. Additionally, we seek to identify any significant differences in biodiversity attributable to climate change. Our research is anchored in the analysis of data from Ecoblitz event.

### Method

We have been examining two different data, iNatualist and Vegetation. 
The iNaturalist data comprises six separate observation datasets, Spring and Fall from 2021 through 2023. These observations were gathered during Ecoblitz events organized by TMCC biology faculties. The events took place in May and October of 2021, May and September of 2022, and May and September of 2023. The initial Ecoblitz event in May 2021 was a full-day affair, while the subsequent five events occurred at predetermined intervals and specific habitats: 8-10 am in forest/grassland, 11 am-1 pm in sagebrush, and 2-4 pm in wetland/riparian areas centered around San Rafael Ranch Park in Reno, Nevada. During these events, faculty members and their students utilized the iNaturalist app to observe and document as many plant, animal, insect, and fungi species as possible.
For the iNaturalist dataset, only observations with associated taxonomy information were included, excluding instances where observers did not specify the observed organism type (e.g., plant, animal, fungi). All observations made within the study site boundaries during each Ecoblitz event were downloaded, ensuring consistency across datasets. However, it's worth noting that there may be additional observations from park visitors that were not part of the Ecoblitz from each Ecoblitz event in iNaturalist.
Additionally, the Vegetation dataset was also collected by TMCC biology faculties and students within San Rafael Ranch Park. Vegetation zones within the park were delineated using satellite imagery, maps, and field surveys. Three natural vegetation zones were identified at the landscape scale: Forest/Grassland, Sagebrush, and Riparian/Wetland. Focused vegetation surveys were conducted at zone using the point-intercept method, documenting flowering phenology in May and October 2021. The point-intercept method is a widely used survey technique for characterizing vegetation cover at the landscape scale.
Both the iNaturalist and Vegetation datasets underwent cleaning and analysis using statistical software, specifically R Studio.
